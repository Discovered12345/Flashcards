# Convert Flashcards in Quizlet to work in Anki

## This script is a web-scraping scrip that uses:
* **Beautifulsoup 4.10.0**
* **Requests 2.26.0**
* **Pandas 1.3.4**
  
I will take the deck from the website, scrape all the information from the front and back of the card and append it to a csv file for easy import into anki.

Instructions
Answer the prompt of how many links you will use (make sure to give a numerical value).

Paste the complete url of the deck

If there is more than one link then add them one by one, you will be promted (I look forward to add a batch pasting option in a near future).

Be patient! Depending on your computer it may be a fast or slow process to collect the data from all the cards.

Name your file. After naming the csv file it will be created and as I previously mentioned, it may take some time for the same reasons as before plus the size of the csv file.
